          The <strong>soil-washing plant</strong> with <strong>ReSoil</strong>{" "}
          technology was constructed in city of Prevalje which sits in a{" "}
          <strong>contaminated area</strong> of Me≈æa Valley, Slovenia. The
          mission of this facility is to prove the <strong>scalability</strong>{" "}
          of ReSoil technology. With the capacity of <strong>6 t/day</strong> it
          enables demonstrational remediation of local sites as well as
          demonstration of ReSoil technology to stakeholders. The{" "}
          <strong>Technology Readiness Level</strong> of plant operation is{" "}
          <strong>TRL 7</strong> (EU, NASA methodology).

          The permit for construction of this soil washing plant was granted by
          Slovenian Environmental Protection Agency in 2017. The permit was
          based on proofs of <strong>ReSoil</strong>&reg; closed process cycles
          operation and <strong>zero-emissions</strong>. Construction of the
          plant was co-financed from EU LIFE + Programme with 50% contribution
          of 1.1 M EUR. The operating permit for this soil-washing plant was
          obtained in July 2018. The <strong>ReSoil</strong>&reg; technology
          uses common process equipment such are <strong>sieves</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>mixing vessels</strong> and <strong>filter presses</strong>.
          The remediation process can be controlled manually and the innovative
          part of <strong>ReSoil</strong>&reg; technology, i.e. in press soil
          rinsing, <strong>EDTA</strong> and process water recycling, can also
          be controlled automatically by the <strong>SCADA</strong>{" "}
          (supervisory, control and data acquisition) system.
